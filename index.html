          tackles profound psychological concepts. The following themes recur

        <article class="mt-16">
          <h2>True Nature of Courage</h2>
          <p class="mt-8">
            The show reframes courage as perseverance in the face of fear.
            Courage’s willingness to protect his family—despite being
            perpetually afraid—illustrates that bravery is defined by action,
            not the absence of terror.

        <article class="mt-16">
          <h2>Isolation & Family</h2>
          <p class="mt-8">
            Set in the desolate plains of “Nowhere, Kansas,” the series
            underscores themes of isolation and the grounding power of familial
            love. The farmhouse is simultaneously a place of vulnerability and
            sanctuary.

          <h2>Trauma & Healing</h2>
          <p class="mt-8">
            Courage’s backstory of abandonment resonates through recurring
            nightmares and flashbacks. Episodes like “Remembrance of Courage
            Past” explore trauma’s lingering effects and the slow journey
            toward self-acceptance.
